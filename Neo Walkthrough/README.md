Welcome to my Three JS Template!

Its a bit of a process to add new example modules, but not too bad!
1. Add the module to it's proper folder location (as it is in threejs-master)
2. Replace the import location 'three' with '..../three.module.js' (or whatever number of periods required if in an atypical file location)
3. Repeat the process with any dependencies this new module has
